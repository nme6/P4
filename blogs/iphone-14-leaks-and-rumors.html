            <p style="float: none; font-size: 18px; padding-left: 51%; margin-top: 2%;"> iPhone leaks and rumors always heat up around the summer of each year as WWDC comes and goes giving us a look at the new iOS version being released alongside it.
            In the case of the iPhone 14 however, the leak and rumors mill seems to be running dry as the wait for WWDC continues onwards. As of right now though, there are quite a few leaks in regard to the iPhone 14 series. For starters,
            we do have a good idea what the phone's front panels will look like, but as with all leaks and rumors, nothing can truly be confirmed until the product is released.
            </p>
            <p style="float: none; font-size: 18px; padding-left: 51%;"> As you can see in the tweet, the iPhone 14 front panels have presumably leaked online and they are... interesting to say the least. For starters, let's talk about the
                line-up of devices. We can see that there is no more "mini" in the lineup. This year's line-up (if leaks are to be believed) will still have 4 models in it, but one of these models will be replacing the "mini" model and will be
                called the iPhone 14 Max. It will have a 6.7 inch display, similar to the Pro Max version of the phone. However, as you can clearly see, the presumed Pro models of the phone are doing away with the notch and going for a pill and
                hole in place of it. I don't know how to feel about it all things considered.
            </p>
            <p class="pb-5" style="float: none; font-size: 18px; padding-left: 51%;">There have been Android phones in the past with either a hole display or pill display, but never both. It seems like Apple is trying to slowly merge over from the notch to a
                notchless display as the technology isn't fully there yet for a "perfect" under-the-display camera with minimal-to-no issues. Waiting for more leaks to come out about both the iPhone 14 & iOS 16 before WWDC22 occurs on June 6th, 2022
                is going to be painful for the leaks/rumors community as there's been little leaks & rumors recently. I'm sure there are more leaks to come out about the iPhone 14, not so much for iOS 16 though, and the developer beta will probably
                come out either the first day of WWDC22 or sometime duringWWDC22. All we can do now is wait and watch for more leaks and rumors to come out whether from leakers or even Apple themselves.
